#### Description of the Tool

This tool is designed to **automatically create the required folders** for object detection training. It simplifies the process of organizing training data by categorizing images into two types: **True (T)** and **False (F)**. 

- **True (T) Images**: These are the images that meet the criteria for the object detection model. They will be saved in the designated "True" folder.
- **False (F) Images**: These are the images that do not meet the criteria and will be saved in the corresponding "False" folder.

The tool ensures that, when used during the data collection or preprocessing phase, all necessary folders are created automatically, eliminating the need for manual setup. This makes it especially helpful for tasks such as gathering and organizing datasets for object detection training.

By using this tool, users can efficiently manage their datasets, ensuring that images are properly categorized and stored in their respective folders. This organization is crucial for effective training of object detection models.
